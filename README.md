# SideEditorV2
### **Original description/plugin from twMat [here](https://sideeditor.tiddlyspot.com/)**
SideEditorV2 floats a tiddlers editor by the story river side.

You see the changes live in the tiddler and you can scroll to, and reference, stuff from other tiddlers while you edit.

## Usage

* Activate SideEditor by clicking the tiddler tool or page tool
* Re-size it via the "handle bars" at upper-right and lower-left corner
* Switch focus between the River and SideEditor by hovering

## Split-out window

* Distraction free authoring by maximizing the window __(Do test it!)__
* Stick window by using 3'd party software (e.g) to easily collect data from other applications and tabs into your wiki
